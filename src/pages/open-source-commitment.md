# Commitment to Open Source

Rugix is developed by [Silitics](https://silitics.com), a company 100% owned and led by its founder [Maximilian Köhl](https://github.com/koehlma).
The various tools of the Rugix Project have been developed out of the concrete needs and requirements of our clients' projects and the strong belief that we can do better when it comes to building reliable embedded devices.

We fund the development of Rugix through consulting and system development work for clients, as well as through [Nexigon](https://nexigon.cloud), our commercial fleet management platform.
We aim for a **clean separation between the open-source project and our commercial offerings**.
Mixing the two creates conflicts of interest that would ultimately hurt both.
We want Rugix to grow independently, on its own merit.
As an example, [delta updates](/blog/efficient-delta-updates) are a feature we built into Rugix, even though other “open core” vendors reserve them for their paid tiers.

To that end, **we are committed to keeping this project open-source and permissively licensed** for the benefit of everyone.
Concretely, this means:

- Rugix tools will remain open-source under their current permissive licenses (MIT and Apache 2.0).
- We will not degrade Rugix functionality to push people toward Nexigon or other offerings.
- **We will not reject any contributions to existing Rugix tools solely on the grounds that they are in conflict with current commercial offerings.** This includes integrations with fleet management solutions that compete with Nexigon.

We strive for maximal transparency with users, contributors, and supporters.
If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us.

# Rugix Admin

_Rugix Admin_ is a web-based admin interface for managing a Rugix system.
In particular, it allows users to update a system simply by uploading an image and it offers direct access to state and system management features.

:::warning

**Rugix Admin is currently a proof of concept and the UX is far from optimal.**

:::

🚧 For now, if you install an update by uploading an image, you will not get any kind of progress indication from the UI and it may seem as nothing is happening. Uploading the image and installing it may take some time. Check your browsers loading indicator to verify whether the image is uploaded and installed. We plan to improve the UI/UX once Rugix's core is production-ready.

By default, Rugix Admin is served on port `8088`.
